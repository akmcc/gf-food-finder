GF FOOD FINDER
=========

The GF Food Finder project was created in an attempt to better understand querying web APIs with OAuth. 

It is a Sinatra application that queries Yelp for gluten-free friendly restaurants in a given city or zipcode.

It is running at http://gf-food-finder.herokuapp.com/

## TODOS:
1. Handle bad user input more effectively
