GF FOOD FINDER
=========

The GF Food Finder project was created in an attempt to better understand querying web APIs with OAuth. 

It is a Sinatra application that queries Yelp for gluten-free friendly restaurants in a given city or zipcode.

To run locally, you will need to obtain consumer keys and tokens from [Yelp's developer page](http://www.yelp.com/developers).

## TODOS:
1. Handle bad user input more effectively
2. Deploy
